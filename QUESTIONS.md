Why are modules constrained to being inside a layer? Couldn't a module have files in two layers?

DRSpaces do cross layer boundries. DRSpaces obvioiusly can consist of many modules. Do they only every consist of whole modules or can they contain submodules?

Are DRSpaces algorithmically detected/defined?

Why is #cochange an absolute number and not a fraction?

4 Cases of files A and B being commited together.
For a given commit, exculively one of the following applies.
Case 1: Neither A or B commited.
Case 2: A in commit, but not B.
Case 3: B in commit, but not A.
Case 4: Both A and B in commit.

Unstable interface uses #cochange.

======================================

Overall objective: Learn the details of the DRH algorithm and archetectural anti-patterns

How: Reimplement DV8 in javascript with d3.js for visualizations

1. Rewrite my DirectedGraph.java to TypeScript
2. Extend DirectedGraph so it can have a "CompositeEdge" set or something similiar
3. Parse the json output of multilang-depends into our graph
4. Attempt to implement DRH as it is described in the research papers

5. Study the Les Miserables source
6. Implement a view for our adjaceny matrix using much of the same technique
