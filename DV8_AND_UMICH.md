# DV8 and UMich

## Goal

We want to find whether the problematic (a) file clusters or (b) individual files identified by UMich overlap with those identified by DV8. How do they differ? How are they similar?

## DV8

The tools included in DV8 are primarily concerned with architecture, or rather, the relationship between files and not just files themselves. 

1. *Decoupling Level (DL) and Propagation Cost (PC)* - These are project-wide metrics. They are given as percentages.
2. *Architecture Anti-Patterns* - 
3. *Architecture Roots* - 

Individual Files:
1. Arh


2. Metrics
   1. Quality Attributes
   2. Design Metrics
   3. Security Metrics
   4. Metrics Comparison Radar Chart
3. TQI Grade
4. Code Smells
